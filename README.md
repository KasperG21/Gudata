# Gudata

The gudata file is a simple json like file format to store variables in a more conventional way.
This originated because I was using json in rust and didn't find it really conventional.
Then I began work on this project and now everything works.
Don't expect a lot of updates because this was just a hobby project and for entertainment purposes.
Consumers are going to need to implement a lot by themselfs for custom structs etc.
